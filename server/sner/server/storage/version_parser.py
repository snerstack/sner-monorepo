    Parses the input, which should have the following format:
    "versions_specifier1; versions_specifier2; ..."

    Supported operators for version specifiers are:
    '==' ('=' also works), '>', '>=', '<', '<=', '!='

    If you use ';' as a separator (e.g. ">=4.0; ==2.0"), then
    at least one of the specifiers must be met.
    But if you use ',' as a separator (e.g. ">=3.0, <4.0"), then
    all of the version specifications in this section must be met.
    So if the specification is ">=3.0, <4.0; ==5.0", then the version
    must either be in range <3.0, 4.0), or it must be equal to 5.0.

    Returns a tuple of product and version specification, which have
    a form of a list of SpecifierSets from packaging library.
